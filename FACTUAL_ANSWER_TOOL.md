# Factual Answer Tool - DuckDuckGo Integration

## ✅ Successfully Created!

The factual answer tool is now working and provides instant answers for financial concepts, definitions, and entity information.

## 🎯 What Works Best

### ✅ Definitions (2-3 word queries)

```bash
# Works great!
"compound interest"      → Full Wikipedia definition
"mutual fund"            → Comprehensive explanation with types
"inflation"              → Economic definition
"equity"                 → Financial concept explanation
"SIP"                    → Systematic Investment Plan definition
```

### ✅ Financial Concepts

```bash
"emergency fund"         → What it is and why it matters
"diversification"        → Investment strategy explanation
"asset allocation"       → Portfolio management concept
"risk management"        → Financial risk concepts
```

### ✅ Company/Entity Information

```bash
"Zerodha"                → Company overview and info
"National Pension System" → Government scheme details
"SEBI"                   → Regulatory body information
```

## ❌ What Doesn't Work

### ❌ Long Questions

```bash
# No results:
"What is compound interest?"  → Too conversational
"How does SIP work?"          → Too specific
"Why should I save money?"    → Opinion-based
```

### ❌ Calculations

```bash
# No results:
"15% of 5000"                 → No calculator function
"compound interest calculator" → No computational results
```

### ❌ How-To Queries

```bash
# No results:
"how to save money"           → Not factual
"best budgeting tips"         → Opinion/advice
"ways to invest"              → Strategy-based
```
