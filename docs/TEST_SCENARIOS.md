## üêõ Common Issues & Debugging

### Issue 1: Mill Doesn't Call query_spending_summary Tool

**Symptoms:**

- User says "show transactions"
- Mill responds "Let me fetch that for you" but shows NO DATA

**Debug Steps:**

1. Check `src/runtime/chatbot-session.ts` line ~209
2. Verify `handleParsedIntent` function exists and is called
3. Test intent parser directly:
   ```javascript
   import { parseUserIntent } from "./src/runtime/intent-parser.js";
   console.log(parseUserIntent("show my transactions"));
   // Should return: { querySummary: true }
   ```
4. Check if Gemini is calling tool (look for tool call logs)
5. Ensure intent parser fallback is active

**Fix:**

- Intent parser should catch this even if Gemini doesn't
- Verify patterns in `src/runtime/intent-parser.ts` match user input

---

### Issue 2: SMS Webhook Returns 401 on All Requests

**Symptoms:**

- Every POST to /sms fails with 401 Unauthorized

**Debug Steps:**

1. Check `.env` has `SMS_WEBHOOK_SECRET` set
2. Verify header in request: `-H "X-Webhook-Secret: <value>"`
3. Check if webhook code has authentication enabled

**Fix:**

- Set `SMS_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env`
- Include header in all requests
- OR disable authentication for testing (not recommended for prod)

---

### Issue 3: Param Generates Placeholder Insights

**Symptoms:**

- `habits.csv` contains "Insufficient History" message

**Debug Steps:**

1. Count transactions: `wc -l data/transactions.csv`
2. Need minimum ~5 transactions for real insights

**Fix:**

- Log more transactions via chat or SMS
- Verify `data/transactions.csv` has data
- Re-run: `npm run analyst`

---

### Issue 4: Coach Briefing Empty or Generic

**Symptoms:**

- `coach-briefings.json` has generic advice

**Debug Steps:**

1. Check if Param has run first
2. Verify `data/habits.csv` has real insights
3. Check Coach prompt includes previous insights

**Fix:**

- Ensure Param ‚Üí Coach handoff is working
- Check `src/runtime/analyst-agent.ts` calls `runCoach`
- Verify Coach reads `habits.csv` correctly

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

**Minimum for Demo:**

- ‚úÖ 8/10 scenarios pass
- ‚úÖ SCENARIO 4 (Query Transactions) MUST PASS
- ‚úÖ SCENARIO 6 (Multi-Agent) MUST PASS
- ‚úÖ No critical crashes
- ‚úÖ Duplicate detection working

**Ideal for Production:**

- ‚úÖ 10/10 scenarios pass
- ‚úÖ All edge cases handled
- ‚úÖ Performance tests pass
- ‚úÖ Security tests pass (webhook auth, rate limiting)

---
